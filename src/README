1. train_test_split_Straified_CV.ipynb
(1.split 2015 dataset and 2019 dataset into five stratified folds
(2. obtain absolute path for each image and so that they can be used easily for processes of triaining and testing

2. balancedData_transformVIsilization.ipynb
(1. to combine a balanced dataset by combining 2015 dataset and 2019 dataset. 
(2. visualize transforms methods by looking at different images 

3. diabetic-retinopathy-eda.ipynb
EDA 

4. baseline-resnet101-vanilla.ipynb
train resnet101 model

5. DenseNetTrain.py
train densenet model

6. DenseNetTest.ipynb
test model trained from DenseNet

7. training_part.py
train efficientNet using different datasets and obtain best models used for testing part 

8. testing_part.ipynb
used to test best model and the result can be obtained by submiting result in kaggle
